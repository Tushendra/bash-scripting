In this Section:
Create and work with arrays
how to iterate with the loop


you will be able to create literal indexed arrays

you will be able to add, remove , update and extract element from indexed arrays

you will be able to use the readarray command to easily generate indexed arrays, without having to type the values out manually for yourself

you will be use for loop to iterate over arrays

you will be able to use loops with logic to perform different actions for each element of an array

e.g
numbers=(1 2 3 4)
echo $number
echo ${number[2]}
echo ${number[@]}
echo ${number[@]:1}
echo ${number[@]:1:2}

add a value to an array
number+=(5)

delete a value from an array
unset number[2]

to check the index:
echo ${!number[@]}

to enter a number in 0th position
numbers[0]=a
