#####
 Command line are just string of characters , some of which have special meanings and some of don't
 we can use backslashes,single quotes and double quotes to remove special meaning from characters.



 Three types of Quoting in bash
 The different effects that these types have on how the shell processes characters on the command line


#// Quoting is about removing special meanings
 1 . Backslash(\):
              Removing special meaning from next character.
 2 . Single Quotes(''):
              Removes special meaning from all characters inside.
	
 3 . Double Quotes(""):
              Removes special meaning from all except dollar sign($) and backticks(`)

examples:
  echo john \& jacob
  filepath=C:\\user\\HP
  filepath1='C:\user\HP'
  filepath2='C:\user\$HOME\HP'  # it won't work as single quote ('') removes special meaning of all characters
  
  filepath2="C:\user\$HOME\HP"  # it will work as double quote ("")
  
  echo filepath
  echo filepath1
