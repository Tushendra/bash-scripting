Two types of operators:

Control Operators:
;(semicolon)	                    More than one command can be used in a singleline.
& (ampersand)	                    Command ends with & and doesn't wait for command to finish.
$?(dollar question mark)	    Used to store exit code of the previous command.
&& (double ampersand)	            Used as logical AND.
|| (double vertical bar)	    Used as logical OR.
Combining && and ||	            Used to write if then else structure in command line.
# (pound sign)	                    Anything written after # will be ignored.
\ (escaping special characters)

Redirection Operators:


Note: Control operators + redirectional operators only matters if they are unquoted.

Points:
1. Unquoted metacharacters distinguish tokens
2. Decide if a token is a word or operator
3. Classify operators as control or redirectional operators
