  5 Step process bash uses to interpret a command line
  step 1 : Tokenization: Token is  a sequence of characters that is considered as a single unit by the shell.
                         The shell decides where a token starts and where a token ends
			 It uses these metacharacters to break up the command line.
			 Metacharacters are :
			 |
			 &
			 ;
			 ()
			 <>
			 space,tab and newline
			 
			 word: A token that does not contain  an unquoted metacharacters
			 Operators: Tokes that contains atleast one unquoted metacharacters
  
  Step 2 : Command Identification:
                       It devides into different commands:
		       First: Simple commands: These are just bunch of individual words, and each simple command is terminated by a control operator
		       
		       second: Compound commands: These provides bash with its programming constructs, such as if statements, for loops, while loops,etc.

  
  Step 3 : Shell Expansion: 
  
  Step 4 : Quote Removal:

  Step 5 : Redirection:

 
 When the shell has done these 5 steps, it will then execute the result.
