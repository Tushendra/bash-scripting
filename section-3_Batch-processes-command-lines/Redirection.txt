Command line processing flow:
Step 5
points to cover:
 1. Redirect Standard output and standard error to a file
 2. Append standard output and standard error to a file
 3. Redirect standard input to choose input sources for your commands

Three stream are there:
 Stream 0 = Standard input (stdin) :
                                    It provides us with an alternative way of providing input to a command, aside from using command line arguments.
 stream 1 = standard output (stdout):
                                    It contains the data that is produced after successful command execution.
 stream 2 = standard error (stderr):
                                   It contains all error messages and status messages that a command produces.

	


  We have three types:
   > for standard output
   2> for standard error
   &> for standard output and standard error
  
  for appending the data 
   >> for standard output
   2>> for standard error
   &>> for standard output and standard error
