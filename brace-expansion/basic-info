#Brace-Expansion
brace expansion is performed using {}
Two types of list that we can expand to within your braces{}:
First type : String List : It can contain any set of individual characters or words
Second type: Range List: It is used for rapidly expanding out sequences of characters to follow a particular order.

Examples:

echo {a,19,z,barry,42}
echo {jan,feb,mar,april,june}

note : we should not give spaces in between the mentioned months or words or characters, else it will not work.
